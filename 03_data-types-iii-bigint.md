<details open>
<summary>BIGINT</summary>

> BigInt is a relatively new addition to JavaScript, introduced to handle integers beyond the maximum safe integer limit. 
> 
> Imagine you're trying to measure the number of stars in a galaxy. Regular numbers in JavaScript would be like trying to count grains of sand on a beachâ€”it's fine for small numbers, but when you're dealing with astronomical quantities, you need something more robust. That's where BigInt comes in handy.
