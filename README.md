## Introduction to JavaScript
### Learning Objectives
 * To learn modern JavaScript's implementation of fundamental programming constructs, students can study topics like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread and rest operators, and object and array methods like map, reduce, filter, and forEach.
 * To understand legacy techniques that create unnecessary complexity and risks, students can study topics like callback hell, global variables, and the use of the var keyword.
 * To implement functional, object-oriented, and asynchronous techniques, students can study topics like functional programming concepts like higher-order functions, closures, and currying, object-oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, and asynchronous programming concepts like promises, async/await, and callbacks.
 * To apply fundamentals of modules to efficiently organize and run programs, students can study topics like the module pattern, CommonJS modules, ES6 modules, and module bundlers like webpack.
 * To write efficient, flexible, and concise programs with metaprogramming, students can study topics like the Proxy and Reflect objects, Symbol objects, and the use of code generation techniques like template engines and transpilers.
 * To extend JavaScript's power via JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and platforms, students can study popular libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and jQuery, as well as platforms like Node.js and Electron.
